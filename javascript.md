# Javascript Resources


| Link | Description | Added by |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| [Eloquent Javascript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/)| Really Interesting book, gives a comprehensive intro to JS|Reuben |
| [You Don't Know JS](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS)| Detailed Look into Javascript, spread over muultiple books. That title should make you read it. Also, Jan Recommends this so you know it's good :D| Reuben|
| [javascript.info](https://javascript.info/)|Another excellent resource to learn both basic and more advanced concepts of javascript. Also has a really good index so you can use this as a quick reference if you forget what recursion is ;) |Reuben |
| [33 JS concepts every developer should know](https://github.com/leonardomso/33-js-concepts) | This is a list of concepts and resources to learn them. Slightly more advanced, so its okay if none of these make any sense right now. I'd recommend coming back to this at various stages of the course. Lots of resources to dive into for potentially confusing topics like callbacks, promises, closures ,the dreaded 'this' keyword, and lots of other fancy javascript words that get thrown about but nobody actually seems to know the meaning of. WOULD BE GREAT FOR INTERVIEW PREP. | Reuben |
|[Event Keycodes](https://keycode.info/)|LIFESAVER. stop googling the keycode for every single key, Just go here, type any key and it shows you the keycode.|Reuben|
